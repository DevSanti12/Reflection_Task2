This application demonstrates the use of:

- Custom Attributes to annotate class properties and store metadata about those properties (e.g., configuration setting name and provider type).
- Dynamic Plugin Loading via Reflection to load external "configuration providers" (DLL files) at runtime, making the application extensible without the need for recompilation.
- A modular architecture that separates configuration logic into plugins (DLL files), allowing provider implementations to be added or swapped easily.
